The PSP uses a 333 MHz MIPS [R4000](https://code.google.com/p/jpcsp/source/detail?r=4000) (32-bit) CPU, a GPU with 2 MB onboard VRAM running
at 166 MHz, and includes 32 MB main RAM (64 MB for PSP Slim) and 4 MB embedded DRAM.
The CPU was originally locked to run slower than the hardware was capable of and
most games ran at 222 MHz. However, with firmware update 3.50 on May 31, 2007,
Sony removed this limit and allowed new games to run at a full 333 MHz.
