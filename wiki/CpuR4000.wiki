=CPU - R4000 The psp processor=

R4000 is a RISC MIPS processor, has 32 registers of general purpose (R0 to R31) 
and 3 for special purpose (PC, HI and LO).
The clock is clocked from 1 to 333MHz

==Registers==
32 general purpose (r0 to r31)
PC a program counter register
HI holds the higher results from divide or multiply operation
LO holds the lower results from divide or multiply operation

_At Multiply operation_
The product of integer multiply operation. (HI and LO)

_At Divide operation_
The quotient is stored on LO and the remainder is stored on HI.

*from 32 general purpose:*
r0 = hardwired to value of zero, can be used as source when zero value is needed.
r31 = is used as link by Jump and Link instructions. (it should not be used by others instructions)

ps: Almost all processor has the status regiter(s), but that one uses the coprocessor (CP0) to control stuffs.

==Instructions==

Each instruction (opcode+...) is a single 4Bytes (32bits) word.
ex:
[31][30][29][28][27][26][25][24][23][22][21][20][19][18][17][16][15][14][13][12][11][10][09][08][07][06][05][04][03][02][01][00]

The opcode is 6 bites. [31][30][29][28][27][26]

===Types of instructions===

There is a three types of instructions format: (AKA addressing modes)
1 - Immediate (imm)
2 - Jump (j)
3 - Register (r)

When is Immediate (imm)

[31][30][29][28][27][26][25][24][23][22][21][20][19][18][17][16][15][14][13][12][11][10][09][08][07][06][05][04][03][02][01][00]
|	opcode	       |        rs         |        rt         |                     immediate                                 |   

opcode = instruction number 	(6bites)
rs = register source 		(5bites) (one of 32 general propurse)
rt = register target 		(5bites) (one of 32 general propurse)
imm = immediate value 		(16bites)

ex:
ADDI R2,R5,0x11; (see and show a sample)


When is Jump (j)

[31][30][29][28][27][26][25][24][23][22][21][20][19][18][17][16][15][14][13][12][11][10][09][08][07][06][05][04][03][02][01][00]
|	opcode	       |        					target                                                 |   

opcode = instruction number 	(6bites)
target = address to jump	(26bites)

ex: (see and show a sample)

When is Register (r)

[31][30][29][28][27][26][25][24][23][22][21][20][19][18][17][16][15][14][13][12][11][10][09][08][07][06][05][04][03][02][01][00]
|	opcode	       |        rs         |        rt         |          rd       |          sa       |    funct              |   

opcode = instruction number 	(6bites)
rs = register source 		(5bites) (one of 32 general propurse)
rt = register target 		(5bites) (one of 32 general propurse)
rd = register destination	(5bites) (one of 32 general propurse)
sa = shift amount 		(5bites)
funct = function filed 		(6bites)

ex: (see and shows a sample)


 * All Load and Store instructions uses the immediate way. (same for coprocessor)
 * Instructions that peforms: arithmetic, logical, shift, multiply and divide uses register and immediate way.
 * Special instructions performs system calls and breakpoint and these are always regiter way.
 * Excpetions instructions occurs in both way immediate and register.
